Deep learning has shown impressive results in machine learning tasks such as
recognition, object detection, and machine translation.

We investigated the design of neural network operators that fuse features
extracted from different modalities, such as audio and video, and use the fused
representation to make predictions on a single task, such as visual question
answer or activity recognition.
