I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Graham Taylor, and the rest of the MLRG
lab for their mentorship and providing an environment where I could learn how
to do research.
I came to the University of Guelph without a research background.
Dr. Taylor and the MLRG members were patient and allowed me to gradually find
my own process for doing research, while providing helpful advice and
discussions that continue through today.
I am thankful that I had the opportunity to work with this group of bright,
kind, motivated people and I hope our collaborations will continue into the
future.

I would also like to thank our academic collaborators from the Deep Vision
project, who are fantastic role models for how to be good scientists.
In particular I would like to thank Dr. Christian Wolf, who provided thoughtful
insight and ideas about our work as well as the machine learning and computer
vision fields in general.

Finally, I would like to thank Shannon Despond for her constant loving support
throughout my studies.
