                Deep neural network acoustic models produce
                substantial gains in large vocabulary
                continuous speech recognition systems.
                Emerging work with rectified linear (ReL)
                hidden units demonstrates additional gains
                in final system performance relative to more
                commonly used sigmoidal nonlinearities. In
                this work, we explore the use of deep rectifier
                networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour
                Switchboard conversational speech recognition
                task. Using simple training procedures
                without pretraining, networks with rectifier
                nonlinearities produce 2% absolute reductions
                in word error rates over their sigmoidal
                counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations
                to quantify differences in how ReL
                units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal
                units. Finally, we evaluate a variant of the
                ReL unit with a gradient more amenable to
                optimization in an attempt to further improve
                deep rectifier networks.

                ReLUs are found to perform similarly to ReLUs, and to converge
                slightly faster.
